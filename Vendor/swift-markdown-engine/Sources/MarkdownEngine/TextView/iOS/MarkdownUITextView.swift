//  MarkdownUITextView.swift
//  MarkdownEngine
//
//  iOS Markdown view (Phase 2a read-only → Phase 2b editable). A `UITextView` on a
//  TextKit-2 stack whose layout-manager delegate installs the cross-platform
//  `MarkdownTextLayoutFragment`; the view is the fragment's `MarkdownFragmentContext`.
//
//  Phase 2b adds: editing with live restyle, the shared list/blockquote/indent/
//  auto-pair input behaviors (via `MarkdownLists.computeListInsertion`), and
//  tap-to-toggle task checkboxes. Out of scope (later passes): marked-text/IME,
//  autocorrect lifecycle, paste, context menus, link taps, undo integration.
