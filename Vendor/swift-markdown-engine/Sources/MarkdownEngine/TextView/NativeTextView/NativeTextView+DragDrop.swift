//  NativeTextView+DragDrop.swift
//  MarkdownEngine
//
//  A rich `NSTextView` registers for image/file/RTF(D) drag types by default and performs
//  its own "insert as `NSTextAttachment` / RTFD / file-path text" drop — which corrupts the
//  editor's plain-Markdown source (a U+FFFC object-replacement char or a stray path
//  round-trips to storage). We can't win this with a host-level SwiftUI `.onDrop`: AppKit
//  routes a drop to the deepest view registered for the type, and the text view is
//  frontmost. So the interception must live ON the text view.
//
//  Guard shape is a DENYLIST-OF-KNOWN-GOOD, not an allowlist of known-bad flavors: we
//  intercept EVERY external drop and never let `super` run for one (an allowlist missed
//  RTFD/attributed-text and file-promise drags, which still corrupt). The only drops left
//  to `super` are intra-view text moves (`draggingSource === self`) — those carry no
//  attachments and rely on the native move + drop-caret behavior.
//
//  Intercepted drops resolve to, in order: file/image items → `onDropAttachment`; else the
//  pasteboard's PLAIN-string flavor (U+FFFC stripped) — never the attributed/RTFD version;
//  else nothing (e.g. an unresolved file promise is swallowed — safe, never corrupting).
