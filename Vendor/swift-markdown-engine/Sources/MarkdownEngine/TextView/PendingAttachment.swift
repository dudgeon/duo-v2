//
//  PendingAttachment.swift
//  MarkdownEngine
//
//  Support for the async attachment disposition (`AttachmentDisposition.pending`). A host
//  that stages dropped bytes asynchronously returns `.pending(resolver)`; the engine inserts
//  a visible loading placeholder at the exact drop caret and hands the host an
//  ``AttachmentResolver`` to call when staging finishes.
//
//  The placeholder is a real image-syntax marker `![name](x-mde-pending:<UUID>)` in the buffer.
//  Because the engine re-derives all styling from the buffer string on every restyle and has no
//  offset-across-edits tracker, a real-text marker TRACKS ITSELF across intervening edits and
//  RE-RENDERS itself each restyle — no separate anchor infrastructure. The marker is stripped at
//  the single emit chokepoint (like the wiki-link `|id`), so the host's `onTextChange` / text
//  binding never sees a half-baked placeholder. On resolve/cancel the engine locates the marker
//  by re-tokenizing (the `.imageLink` token whose URL is the pending scheme + UUID) and replaces
//  or deletes it through the undoable path.
//
//  Known limitation (undo): the placeholder insert and its resolution are two independent undoable
//  edits, so undoing a RESOLVED attachment reverts the reference back into a placeholder marker
//  whose resolver has already fired — it renders as a stuck "Uploading…" chip until the user
//  deletes it or redoes. Purely visual: the marker is stripped at the emit chokepoint, so the host
//  never sees it and there is no data loss. Coalescing the two edits across the async boundary (or
//  teaching the styler which markers are orphaned) is disproportionate to a rare, host-invisible,
//  user-recoverable glitch, so it is left as documented behavior.
