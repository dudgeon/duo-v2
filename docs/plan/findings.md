# Duo v2 — Build findings

What building and testing taught us, in order. Each finding says what was observed, how, and what it changed. Facts here are verified on this machine unless marked otherwise. Open questions and risks go in `concerns-and-questions.md`; decisions go in `../design/decisions.md`.

Machine: macOS 27.0 (26A428), Apple silicon, Command Line Tools only (Swift 6.4, SDK MacOSX27.0), Chrome 154.

---

## F-1 · Chrome 154 never exits after a headless screenshot or DOM dump (2026-10-03)

- **Observed:** `render-references.sh` hung on its first call. `--screenshot` and `--dump-dom` both write their output, then the process stays alive indefinitely, with or without `--virtual-time-budget` or `--disable-gpu`.
- **Changed:** `docs/design/build-handoff/tools/lib.sh` `chrome_run` now runs Chrome in the background and stops it once the screenshot file stops growing or the dumped DOM reaches `</html>` (bounded by `CHROME_TIMEOUT`, default 60 s). All nine references render in about 14 s.

## F-2 · The Command Line Tools can build the whole app, minus Xcode's macro plugins (2026-10-03)

- **Observed:** the CLT SDK includes SwiftUI, AppKit, WebKit and Observation, and `swift build` produces a working SwiftUI app. But `@State` is a macro in this SDK and fails with "plugin for module 'SwiftUIMacros' not found". Swift Testing's `@Test` fails the same way ("TestingMacros"), and XCTest isn't present. `@Observable` works (its macros ship with the toolchain). There is no `actool`, so no asset catalogs.
- **Changed:** DL-30 (Xcode-free as policy); ADR-0001. App-level state is an `@Observable` class held by `let`. Checks run as an executable (`swift run DuoChecks`). Colours are generated Swift from `tokens.json` (`scripts/gen-tokens.py`).
- **Watch:** views must avoid SwiftUI macros (`@State`, `@Entry`, `#Preview`, `@Previewable`). Use `@Observable` models, `@Environment`, and plain `let`/`var`.

## F-3 · Window rendering is in the display's colour space unless pinned (2026-10-03)

- **Observed:** captured token colours came back one unit off in one channel (`#15181C` for `#15171B`) after the capture converted from the display's colour space to sRGB.
- **Changed:** fixture mode sets `window.colorSpace = .sRGB`. Captured pixels now equal token values exactly.

## F-4 · The system's compact toolbar is 40 pt on macOS 27, not 38 (2026-10-03)

- **Observed:** with `.unifiedCompact(showsTitle: false)`, the window is 902 pt tall when the content area below the toolbar is 862 pt.
- **Changed:** nothing in the targets. Per handoff §0.4 the system wins; fixture mode sizes the content area to exactly 1440×862 so `compare.sh --content-only` lines up.

## F-5 · Pane edges match the targets to the point (2026-10-03)

- **Observed:** with a custom `NSSplitView` (1 pt token-coloured dividers; a pane's border counted inside its width, as the targets draw it), sampling row y = 500 gives All projects 0–339 `console`, 339–340 `consoleRule`, 340–1100 `pane`, 1100–1101 `rule`, 1101–1440 `pane`; Inside a project 0–299, 299–300 `rule`, 300–980 `console`, 980–981 `rule`, 981–1440. Identical to the targets.
- **How:** `scripts/pixels.py` (dependency-free PNG sampler) against `screens/png/*@2x.png`.

## F-6 · Toolbar items need a flexible spacer to reach the trailing edge (2026-10-03)

- **Observed:** a `.primaryAction` item sat directly after the `.navigation` items, not at the trailing edge as the target's `margin-left: auto` places it.
- **Changed:** `ToolbarSpacer(.flexible)` before the Jump field. Toolbar items also use `.sharedBackgroundVisibility(.hidden)` so macOS 27 doesn't put each in a glass capsule.

## F-7 · Whole-window capture needs Screen Recording (2026-10-03)

- **Observed:** `screencapture -l <window>` fails without the Screen Recording permission for the launching app.
- **Changed:** `--capture-window` falls back to drawing the window's frame view, which shows the toolbar's contents (the part §0.4 says to match) though not always the system material. The main comparison path is content-only and needs no permission.
